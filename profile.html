        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>My career goals are simply to find a job as soon as I can after graduating from this school. I currently work at 
            Discount tire and have been there for 9 years so far. So when I finish school I will look into whether they have 
            some positions in the field that I am in and apply within the company. But I will also be looking for other career paths
            that are available to me from this school's outcomes.
